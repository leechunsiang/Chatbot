Ensuring the well-being of our students is a priority.\n\nUTAR provides several resources to support student mental health:\n\n*   **Student Counselling Services**: UTAR has dedicated counselling services available on both our Kampar and Sungai Long campuses. These services are confidential and are provided by qualified counsellors. Students can seek support for a wide range of issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, personal challenges, and academic pressures.\n\n    *   **How to access:** Typically, you can make an appointment by visiting the counselling center on campus or by contacting them directly via phone or email. Information on how to book an appointment is usually available on the UTAR student portal or through departmental announcements.\n\n*   **Student Affairs Department**: The Student Affairs Department often plays a role in facilitating student well-being initiatives, which can include mental health awareness programs and events. They are a good point of contact for general student welfare.\n\n*   **Peer Support Networks**: While not a formal mental health service, UTAR fosters a sense of community through various student clubs and societies. Engaging with peers and participating in extracurricular activities can also contribute positively to mental well-being.\n\n*   **Health Centers/Clinics**: UTAR's medical centers on campus can also be a starting point for students experiencing mental health concerns. They can provide initial assessments and referrals to specialized counselling services if needed.\n\n**For the most current and specific information on accessing these services, including contact details and operating hours, I highly recommend visiting the official UTAR website or checking the student portal. You can also directly contact the Student Affairs Department or the Counselling Unit on your respective campus.**\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with regarding UTAR's resources or student life?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is the library"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "UTAR has libraries located at both of its main campuses to serve our students and faculty.\n\n*   **Kampar Campus Library**: The main library is located at the **Kampar Campus**.
